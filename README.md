My name is Sam Kimball-Sperberg and I am a Creative Media student at Champlain College. This is my portfolio site. Mood and setting are focal points of my work; writing, poetry, and visual art of mine is heavily influenced by—or in the case of digital art, often literally constructed from—environments I’ve been in. I create art that evokes the feeling of a setting or narrative, whether it’s through my drawings, writing, or a soundscape.

Much of my work is currently centered around the exploration of different unique physical mediums, such as stickers and cassette tapes. A common theme in my work is nostalgia; I have a fascination with old technology that bleeds through into my drawings, photography, and the mediums I work with. I grew up obsessed with Shonen Jump manga, and artists like Akira Toriyama and Hiroyuki Takei remain major influences on my art style. I work best when I’m not concerned about how my work will turn out, so a lot of my best pieces start off as doodles in a notebook.
